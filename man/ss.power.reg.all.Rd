\description{
\code{ss.power.reg.all} returns the necessary total sample size
  to achieve a desired level of statistical power for a test of model R2
  in a planned study using multiple regression, based on information
  obtained from a previous study.The effect from the previous study
  can be corrected for publication bias and/or uncertainty to provide
  a sample size that will achieve more accurate statistical power for a
  planned study, when compared to approaches that use a sample effect size at
  face value or rely on sample size only. The bias and uncertainty adjusted
  previous study noncentrality parameter is also returned, which can be
  transformed to various effect size metrics.
}
\details{
Researchers often use the sample effect size from a prior study as
  an estimate of the likely size of an expected future effect in sample size
  planning. However, sample effect size estimates should not usually be used
  at face value to plan sample size, due to both publication bias and
  uncertainty.

  The approach implemented in \code{ss.power.reg.all} uses the observed
  \eqn{F}-value and sample size from a previous study to correct the
  noncentrality parameter associated with the effect of interest for
  publication bias and/or uncertainty. This new estimated noncentrality
  parameter is then used to calculate the necessary total sample size to
  achieve the desired level of power in the planned study.

  The approach uses a likelihood function of a truncated non-central F
  distribution, where the truncation occurs due to small effect sizes being
  unobserved due to publication bias. The numerator of the likelihood
  function is simply the density of a noncentral F distribution. The
  denominator is the power of the test, which serves to truncate the
  distribution. In the single predictor case, this formula reduces to the density
  of a truncated noncentral \eqn{t}-distribution.(See Taylor & Muller, 1996,
  Equation 2.1. and Anderson & Maxwell, 2017, for more details.)

  Assurance is the proportion of times that power will be at or above the
  desired level, if the experiment were to be reproduced many times. For
  example, assurance = .5 means that power will be above the desired level
  half of the time, but below the desired level the other half of the time.
  Selecting assurance = .5 (selecting the noncentrality parameter at the 50th
  percentile of the likelihood distribution) results in a median-unbiased
  estimate of the population noncentrality parameter and corrects for
  publication bias only. In order to correct for uncertainty, assurance > .5
  can be selected, which corresponds to selecting the noncentrality parameter
  associated with the (1 - assurance) quantile of the likelihood
  distribution.

  If the previous study of interest has not been subjected to publication
  bias (e.g., a pilot study), \code{alpha.prior} can be set to 1 to indicate
  no publication bias. Alternative \eqn{\alpha}-levels can also be
  accommodated to represent differing amounts of publication bias. For
  example, setting \code{alpha.prior}=.20 would reflect less severe
  publication bias than the default of .05. In essence, setting
  \code{alpha.prior} at .20 assumes that studies with \eqn{p}-values less
  than .20 are published, whereas those with alrger \eqn{p}-values are not.

  In some cases, the corrected noncentrality parameter for a given level of
  assurance will be estimated to be zero. This is an indication that, at the
  desired level of assurance, the previous study's effect cannot be
  accurately estimated due to high levels of uncertainty and bias. When this
  happens, subsequent sample size planning is not possible with the chosen
  specifications. Two alternatives are recommended. First, users can select a
  lower value of assurance (e.g. .8 instead of .95). Second, users can reduce
  the influence of publciation bias by setting \code{alpha.prior} at a value
  greater than .05. It is possible to correct for uncertainty only by setting
  \code{alpha.prior}=1 and choosing the desired level of assurance. We
  encourage users to make the adjustments as minimal as possible.
