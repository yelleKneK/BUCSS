# Multiple Linear Regression: Joint test of multiple predictors

#' Necessary sample size to reach desired power for a test of multiple predictors
#' in a multiple regression using an uncertainty and publication bias correction
#' procedure
#'
#' @description \code{ss.power.reg.joint} returns the necessary total sample size
#'   to achieve a desired level of statistical power for a test of multiple
#'   predictors in a planned study using multiple regression, based on information
#'   obtained from a previous study.The effect from the previous study
#'   can be corrected for publication bias and/or uncertainty to provide
#'   a sample size that will achieve more accurate statistical power for a
#'   planned study, when compared to approaches that use a sample effect size at
#'   face value or rely on sample size only. The bias and uncertainty adjusted
#'   previous study noncentrality parameter is also returned, which can be
#'   transformed to various effect size metrics.
#'
#' @details Researchers often use the sample effect size from a prior study as
#'   an estimate of the likely size of an expected future effect in sample size
#'   planning. However, sample effect size estimates should not usually be used
#'   at face value to plan sample size, due to both publication bias and
#'   uncertainty.
#'
#'   The approach implemented in \code{ss.power.reg.joint} uses the observed
#'   \eqn{F}-value and sample size from a previous study to correct the
#'   noncentrality parameter associated with the effect of interest for
#'   publication bias and/or uncertainty. This new estimated noncentrality
#'   parameter is then used to calculate the necessary total sample size to
#'   achieve the desired level of power in the planned study.
#'
#'   The approach uses a likelihood function of a truncated non-central F
#'   distribution, where the truncation occurs due to small effect sizes being
#'   unobserved due to publication bias. The numerator of the likelihood
#'   function is simply the density of a noncentral F distribution. The
#'   denominator is the power of the test, which serves to truncate the
#'   distribution. In the single predictor case, this formula reduces to the density
#'   of a truncated noncentral \eqn{t}-distribution.(See Taylor & Muller, 1996,
#'   Equation 2.1. and Anderson & Maxwell, 2017, for more details.)
#'
#'   Assurance is the proportion of times that power will be at or above the
#'   desired level, if the experiment were to be reproduced many times. For
#'   example, assurance = .5 means that power will be above the desired level
#'   half of the time, but below the desired level the other half of the time.
#'   Selecting assurance = .5 (selecting the noncentrality parameter at the 50th
#'   percentile of the likelihood distribution) results in a median-unbiased
#'   estimate of the population noncentrality parameter and does not correct for
#'   uncertainty. In order to correct for uncertainty, assurance > .5
#'   can be selected, which corresponds to selecting the noncentrality parameter
#'   associated with the (1 - assurance) quantile of the likelihood
#'   distribution.
#'
#'   If the previous study of interest has not been subjected to publication
#'   bias (e.g., a pilot study), \code{alpha.prior} can be set to 1 to indicate
#'   no publication bias. Alternative \eqn{\alpha}-levels can also be
#'   accommodated to represent differing amounts of publication bias. For
#'   example, setting \code{alpha.prior}=.20 would reflect less severe
#'   publication bias than the default of .05. In essence, setting
#'   \code{alpha.prior} at .20 assumes that studies with \eqn{p}-values less
#'   than .20 are published, whereas those with larger \eqn{p}-values are not.
#'
#'   In some cases, the corrected noncentrality parameter for a given level of
#'   assurance will be estimated to be zero. This is an indication that, at the
#'   desired level of assurance, the previous study's effect cannot be
#'   accurately estimated due to high levels of uncertainty and bias. When this
#'   happens, subsequent sample size planning is not possible with the chosen
#'   specifications. Two alternatives are recommended. First, users can select a
#'   lower value of assurance (e.g. .8 instead of .95). Second, users can reduce
#'   the influence of publciation bias by setting \code{alpha.prior} at a value
#'   greater than .05. It is possible to correct for uncertainty only by setting
#'   \code{alpha.prior}=1 and choosing the desired level of assurance. We
#'   encourage users to make the adjustments as minimal as possible.
#'
#' @param F.observed Observed \eqn{F}-value from a previous study used to plan
#'   sample size for a planned study
#' @param N Total sample size of the previous study
#' @param p Number of predictors; be sure to include any product terms or
#'   polynomials that are in the model
#' @param p.joint Number of predictors tested jointly for significance
#' @param alpha.prior Alpha-level \eqn{\alpha} for the previous study or the
#'   assumed statistical significance necessary for publishing in the field; to
#'   assume no publication bias, a value of 1 can be entered 
#' @param alpha.planned Alpha-level (\eqn{\alpha}) assumed for the planned study
#' @param assurance Desired level of assurance, or the long run proportion of
#'   times that the planned study power will reach or surpass desired level
#'   (assurance > .5 corrects for uncertainty; assurance < .5 not recommended)
#' @param power Desired level of statistical power for the planned study
#' @param step Value used in the iterative scheme to determine the noncentrality
#'   parameter necessary for sample size planning (0 < step < .01) (users should
#'   not generally need to change this value; smaller values lead to more
#'   accurate sample size planning results, but unnecessarily small values will
#'   add unnecessary computational time)
